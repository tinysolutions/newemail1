				<h1>what the fuck?</h1>
				A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in

				<h1>cure for cancer</h1>
				Whenever life gets you down...
				Keeps you wearing a frown...
				And the gravy train has left you behind
				And when you're all out of hope...
				Down at the end of your rope...
				And nobody is there to thrown you a line

				<h1>mother shitfuck</h1>
				If you ever get so low
				That you don't know which way to go,
				Come on and take a walk in my shoes
				Never worry about a thing
				Got the world on a string
				'Cause I got the cure for all of my blues...
				(All of his blues...)

				<h1>big penis</h1>
				I take a look at my enormous penis
				And my troubles start melting away
				I take a look at my enormous penis
				And the happy times are coming to stay
				I gotta sing and I dance
				When I glance in my pants
				And the feelings like a sunshiny day...
				I take a look at my enormous penis
				And everything is going my way
